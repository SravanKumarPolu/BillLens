# BillLens Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## 🔒 Privacy & Security First

BillLens is built with privacy and security as core principles. Your data belongs to you — not us.

## Your Data Ownership

**We never sell your data.** Period.

- All data is stored locally on your device
- Your financial information stays private
- No third-party data sharing
- No advertising or tracking

## Data Storage

### Local Storage

- **All data is stored locally** on your device using AsyncStorage
- Data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to sync or share
- Works completely offline — internet not required
- You have full control over your data

### Optional Cloud Sync

- Cloud sync is **completely optional**
- Only enabled when you sign in (which is optional)
- You can use BillLens fully without any account
- Sync happens only to your own account
- You can disable sync anytime

## Data Collection

**We collect zero data for advertising or analytics.**

The app only stores:
- Your expense data (locally on your device)
- Groups and members you create
- Settings and preferences (local only)

We do NOT:
- Track your location
- Share data with third parties
- Sell data to advertisers
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Store payment information (only expense records)

## Security Features

### Encryption (Optional)
